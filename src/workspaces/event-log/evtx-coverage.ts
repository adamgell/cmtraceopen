/**
 * Accumulating the report of what is missing from a loaded set of events.

 * Lives outside the store because the store imports the Tauri IPC bridge at module scope, which a
 * unit test cannot load. The rule being tested is small but easy to get wrong in a way nobody
 * notices: gaps must accumulate across channels, and must not multiply when a channel is
 * re-queried.
 */

/**
 * Merges newly reported gaps into the ones already on screen.
 *
 * Channels load one at a time and each reports its own gaps, so these accumulate rather than
 * replace. They are deduplicated because re-querying a channel reports the same gap again, and a
 * banner that grows every refresh trains an operator to stop reading it.
 *
 * Order is preserved so a gap does not move around the list as more channels finish.
